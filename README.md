Wordpress Isotope Plugin

I really like the jQuery Isotope plugin, which helps you create rich and modern portfolio. I didn't find Isotope plugin at WordPress plugins website at the time, so I thought it would be a great idea to develop my own WordPress Isotope plugin. Development involved back-end custom post coding and front-end for proper rendering of isotope with variables from back-end.

Installation:
- create new folder inside of wp-content\plugins\ and name it isotope(or your name)
- copy the files inside your newly created folder
- go to your wordpress admin-area and you will already see FZ Isotope plugin - activate it
- you will find new menu option called FZ Project in your admin-area menu, where you can add your projects
- use [fzisotope] shortcode to show your Isotope plugin on your front-end
